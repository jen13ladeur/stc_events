    <h3>About The Event</h3>
    <p>The 36th annual Scarecrow Festival, presented by AAA, will be held October 8-10 in downtown St. Charles. 85 Handmade scarecrows will be showcased around town for visitors to view, vote for their favorites, and visit our many local businesses. There will be a Family Zone with live entertainment and family activities, a festive photo op area, specials and promotions throughout town, and the Autumn on the Fox Craft Show in Pottawatomie Park.

 

        A new addition to the event this year is the Family Zone which will have live entertainment and family activities throughout the weekend.
